# Phase 2 â€“ Agile Modeling and MVP Design

The goal of this phase was to **develop the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** of the Online Education Management System through interactive modeling and iterative feedback. We utilized the **Scrum methodology** to organize our workflow and prioritize features based on user needs.

### Key Deliverables:

- An initial interactive **prototype** of the system  
- **Activity Diagram** and **Sequence Diagram** for selected complex use cases  
- Defined **Product Backlog**, **Sprint Backlog**, and Agile boards (via Jira)  
- Visual modeling and wireframes created using **Figma**

In this phase, I was responsible for **designing use case flows and turning them into visual wireframes and components in Figma**. The designs were directly based on the system requirements and use cases previously extracted in Phase 1.

This work ensured that the MVP accurately reflected real user interactions and functional goals.
