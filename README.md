# Online Education Management System

This repository contains a three-phase project for designing and developing an **Online Education Management System**. The objective of this project was to **analyze, design, prototype, and test a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** by applying core principles and methodologies of **Software Engineering**.

The platform is designed to provide a unified environment for live online classes, enabling direct communication between instructors and students while addressing limitations of traditional, location-based education.

## Project Structure and Phase Overview

### 📁 Phase 1 – Requirements and Analysis

In this phase, we focused on defining the system scope and gathering key requirements. We also modeled the core concepts and interactions within the system. Our work included:

- Identifying functional and non-functional requirements
- Defining user roles and use case scenarios
- Creating UML diagrams: Use Case, Domain Model, ER Diagram, Class Diagram
- Developing a system-specific glossary

Tools Used: `Visual Paradigm`

📂 [See Phase 1 Details](./PHASE1)

### 📁 Phase 2 – Agile Modeling and Prototyping

In Phase 2, we applied an **Agile (Scrum)** methodology to iteratively refine the system's design and interactions. We:

- Designed detailed **Sequence** and **Activity Diagrams** for selected use cases
- Built interactive wireframes and prototypes using **Figma**
- Managed sprints, backlogs, and task distribution via **Jira**
- Assigned the Scrum Master role to a team member for coordination

Tools Used: `Figma`, `Jira`

### 📁 Phase 3 – Testing and Quality Assurance

This phase focused on validating the system's quality and verifying that it met user expectations. Our contributions included:

- Writing detailed **test cases** for core and edge use cases
- Performing **functional**, **performance**, **security**, and **accessibility** tests
- Creating **pseudocode** and **control flow graphs** to ensure code-level clarity
- Conducting an **A/B test** to compare design variations and evaluate user behavior
