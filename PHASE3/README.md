# Phase 3 â€“ Testing and Quality Assurance

The third phase of the project focused on ensuring the quality, correctness, and usability of the system through various testing techniques. We validated the system against both **functional** and **non-functional requirements**, and used structured approaches to verify design assumptions and user interactions.

### Key Deliverables:

- Detailed **Test Cases** for core and edge scenarios
- Non-functional tests including **Performance**, **Accessibility**, and **Security**
- **Pseudocode** and **Control Flow Graphs** for complex logic
- **A/B Testing** to evaluate design decisions based on user feedback

In this phase, I was responsible for conducting **A/B testing** based on one of the selected use cases.  
I designed two versions of a specific user interaction and created a **questionnaire-based survey** to gather feedback and behavior data from participants. Based on the results, I tested the hypothesis and evaluated which design performed better.

This experiment provided valuable insight into user preferences and helped guide final design decisions.
