#  Phase 1 â€“ Requirements and System Analysis

This phase focused on defining the **core structure** of the system by identifying its functional requirements, key user interactions, and domain logic. Our objective was to capture a clear picture of what the system should do before moving toward implementation.

### ðŸ§  Key Deliverables:

- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Detailed Use Case descriptions (including Main Flow and Alternative Flows)
- Domain Model and Class Diagram
- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
- Visual modeling using **Visual Paradigm**
### ðŸ‘¤ Contribution â€“ Ali Tabatabaei

In this phase, I was responsible for **collecting and analyzing system requirements** and transforming them into structured **Use Case specifications**. Together with **Danial Hamidi**, we extracted and documented **27 detailed use cases**, each of which included:

- Main Flow of Events  
- Alternative and Exception Flows  
- Preconditions and Postconditions  
- Primary Actors and Descriptions

This effort laid a strong analytical foundation for the later modeling and implementation phases.
